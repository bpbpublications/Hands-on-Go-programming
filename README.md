# Hands-on Go Programming

Learn Googleâ€™s Golang Programming, Data Structures, Error Handling and Concurrency

This is the code repository for [Hands-on Go Programming ](https://bpbonline.com/products/hands-on-go-programming?_pos=1&_sid=a87d7cf5c&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book

## About the Book
Hands-on Go Programming is designed to get you up and running as fast as possible with Go. You will not just learn the basics but get introduced to how to use advanced features of Golang.

The book begins with the basic concepts of Data types, Constants, Variables, Operators, Reassignment, and Redeclaration. Moving ahead, we explore and learn the use of Functions, Control flows, Arrays, Slices, Maps, and Structs using some great examples and illustrations. We then get to know about Methods in Golang. Furthermore, we learn about complex aspects of Golang such as Interfaces,Pointers, Concurrency and Error Handling.

By the end, you will be familiar with both the basics and advanced concepts of Go and start developing critical programs working using this language.


## What you will learn
* Learn Golang syntaxes, control structures and Error Handling in-depth.
* Learn to declare, create and modify Slices, Maps and Struct in Go.
* Build your own concurrent programs with Goroutines and Channels.
* Deep Dive into Error handling in Golang.
